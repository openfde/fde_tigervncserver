# /etc/vnc.conf written by Joachim Falk. This file is in the Public Domain.
#
# This is the configuration file for the vncserver package.
# It is perl syntax and is source from the tigervncserver script.
# Every value has suitable defaults, so you probably don't need any modifications.
#
# After this file, $(HOME)/.vnc/vnc.conf will be sourced, so values can be
# overwritten on a per-user basis. If you want to reactivate the default
# value there, you have to specify an empty value. For example, $fontPath
# will set to the default value after
#
# $fontPath = "/foo";
# $fontPath = "";
#
# If you are missing something, please let me know.

# System configuration
# --------------------
#
# This section contains entries that should be true for all users.

# $vncClasses should be the path to the java classes of server.
# $vncClasses = "/usr/share/vncserver";

# $XFConfigPath   can be set to the global XF86Config file. This will be
#                 parsed to gain default values for $fontPath and $colorPath.
#                 If you want to disable this feature, point it to an
#                 invalid file, "/foo" for example.
# $XFConfigPath = "/etc/X11/xorg.conf";

# $fontPath should be a comma seperated list of fonts to be added to the font
#           path. If not specified, and $XFConfigPath is valid, vncserver
#           will read the $fontPath from there. If both are not set, the
#           default will apply.
# Example:
#	$fontPath = "tcp/localhost:7100"; # would force vnc to use xfs.
# Example:
#	$fontPath = "";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic,";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/:unscaled,";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/:unscaled,";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1,";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi,";
#	$fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi,";
# I don't know what the default is, though.
#$fontPath = join(",", grep { $_ =~ m/^unix/; } split(/,/,$fontPath) ); # local font server
$fontPath = ""; # use default

# $colorPath should be the RGB file to be used by X. This can also be taken from
#            XF86Config file if specified by $XFConfigPath
# $colorPath = "/etc/X11/rgb";

# User configuration
# ------------------
#
# This section contains entries that may change from user to user.

# $vncUserDir contains the filename for the log files directory of Xvnc
#             (the server) and the viewers that are connected to it.
# $vncUserDir = "$ENV{HOME}/.vnc";

# $vncPasswdFile contains the filename of the password file for Xvnc.
# $vncPasswdFile = $vncUserDir . "/passwd";

# $vncStartup points to a script that will be started at the very beginning.
# $vncStartup = "/etc/X11/Xsession";
$vncStartup = "/etc/X11/Xvnc-session";

# $xauthorityFile should be the path to the authority file that should be used
#                 by your vnc X server.
# $xauthorityFile = "$ENV{HOME}/.Xauthority";

# $defaultDesktopName should be set to the default name of the desktop.
#                     This can be changed at the command line with -name.
# $defaultDesktopName = "X";

# $geometry sets framebuffer width & height. Default will be calculated if
#           server is started from within a running X servers. Can be changed at
#           the commandline (-geometry). A fixed default will be used if
#           vncserver is not invoked in a running X session.
# Example:  $geometry ="640x480";
#
# For xrandr support:
# $geometry = "1900x1200";
$geometry = "1900x1200";

# $wmDecoration sets the adjustment of $geometry to accommodate the window decoration
#               used by the x11 window manager. This is used to fully display
#               the vnc desktop even if the vnc viewer is not in full screen mode.
# Example:      $wmDecoration = "4x24";
$wmDecoration = "0x0";

# $depth       sets the framebuffer color depth. Must be between 8 and 32.
# $pixelformat sets the default pixelformat.
#              The default will be calculated if none of both is specified
#              and when vncserver is called from within a running X servers.
#              Can be changed at the command line with option -depth.
#              A fixed default value will be used if vncserver is not
#              invoked in a running X session.
# Example:  $depth = "16";
#           $pixelformat = "rgb565";
$depth = "32";

# $getDefaultFrom sets the display from which you can query the default of
#                 the above three options, if you don't want to start vncserver
#                 from within a running X server. It will be added to the call
#                 of xdpyinfo.
#                 It is useful to get the default from the X server you will
#                 run xvncviewer in.
# Example:  $getDefaultFrom = "-display localhost:0"

# $rfbwait sets the maximum time in msec to wait for vnc client viewer.
# $rfbwait = "120000";

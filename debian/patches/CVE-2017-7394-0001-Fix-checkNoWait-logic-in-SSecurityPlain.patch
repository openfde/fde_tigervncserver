Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fix checkNoWait logic in SSecurityPlain.

Currently it proceeds only if there aren't enough data in queue and then it blocks waiting.
Also the required amount to receive from network is (ulen + plen), not (ulen + plen + 2).

This allowed not authenticated clients to deny service to everyone.

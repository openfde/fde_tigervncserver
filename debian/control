Description: Virtual network computing; Common software needed by servers
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides the
 vncpasswd and vncconfig tools.

Description: Virtual network computing server performing X screen scraping
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a VNC server that perform screen scraping of an already
 running X server to provide its VNC desktop. The VNC desktop can be viewed
 by any VNC viewer even on other operating systems.
 .
 Note: If you only want to scrape your local X11 server, you should consider
 the tigervnc-xorg-extension package. This package provides the vnc extension
 for your local X11 server. The usage of this extension is more efficient
 than a scraping vnc server.

Description: Standalone virtual network computing server 
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a standalone VNC server to which clients can connect.
 The server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 Note: This server does not need a display. You need a VNC viewer to see
 something. This viewer may also be on a computer running other operating
 systems.

Description: Virtual network computing X server extension
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package contains an X server connector so VNC clients can connect to your
 local X desktop directly.

Description: Virtual network computing client for X
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a VNC client for X. With this you can connect to a
 VNC server and display its content. There are VNC servers available for other
 operating systems.

#Description: Virtual network computing java applet and command line program
# VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
# display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
# not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
# Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
# .
# It contains a java viewer implementation that can either be used as an applet,
# typically served by the built in web server provided by Xvnc
# (tigervnc-standalone-server) or from command line using a Java JRE.
